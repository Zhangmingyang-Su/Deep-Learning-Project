# Stock Prices and Market Index Prediction based on Recurrent Neural Network
In this project, I perform a time series prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network regressor. For this example, I will predict Apple's stock price 7 days in advance.

The particular network architecture I will employ for my RNN is a Long Term Short Memory (LTSM), which helps significantly avoid technical problems with optimization of RNNs.

# Pytorch LSTM Stock Predictor

This is a Pytorch version of the original Keras LSTM Stock Predictor provided by [Super DataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/), and also available elsewhere in this repo as a notebook.
